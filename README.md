## What is CMake?

Make (or rather a Makefile) is a buildsystem - it drives the compiler and other build tools to build your code. CMake is a generator of buildsystems. It can produce Makefiles, it can produce Ninja build files, it can produce KDEvelop or Xcode projects, it can produce Visual Studio solutions.

## Why learn CMake?

I've primarily exposed to the Java build system. Want to get some basic understanding of the build systems for C/C++, recent projects require me to have a good grip of C/C++ projects.

This project is a mix of many open source blogs & projects for record. The default documentation on CMake official website is as bad as many other open source projects.

## Prereq
$ sudo apt install libboost-dev
$ sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
